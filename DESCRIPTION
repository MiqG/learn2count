Description:
   Implements a general and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model that
   can be used to infer a graph structure from multivariate zero-inflated data.
   The model accounts for a set of covariates in addition to the graph 
   structure. Its natural application is to learn co-expression networks in 
   single-cell RNA-seq data.
